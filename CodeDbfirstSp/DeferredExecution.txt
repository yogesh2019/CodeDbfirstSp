a v imp topic called deferred execution

so here we all the list of courses 

we are gonna get them via 

_context.courses 
and display them on console

so let see what happens behind the scene	

we will put debugger on dbcontext

and will see sequel server profiler

so at point when we reach the for loop you might think 

that the entity framework has ran the query on our database

and we can see the actual query that was run by entity framework

queries are not executing at the time you create them

and are executed when one of the situation happens

* iterating over query variable
* calling ToLIst, ToArray, ToDictionalry

array methods return singleton value

this is what we called deferred execution 


deferred execution enables query to be extended


now let say we add a property in our dommain

and we can also add methods in our domain

now if we do lilke 

var courses = context.Courses.Where( c => c.IsBeginnerCourse == true)
here we will get a runtime exception



as this is a customer query and not accesible by entity framework

in this case 

we use immediate execution


so i will put courses.ToList() 
here then use our method

and this will have performance affect 
as this will load all the data from memory just to filter them
