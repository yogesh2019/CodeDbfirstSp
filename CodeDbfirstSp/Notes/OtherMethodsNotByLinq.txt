partioning

this is useful 

when you want return a page of records

imagine you are sending a page of records and you are sending
10 records per page

dbContext.skip(10).Take(10)

**************

element operators
till now we are returning a list of courses

context.Coures.First

or we can do 
Orderby(c => c.level).FirstOrDefault()

in this case its gonna return null

we can also supply a predicate

orderBy(c => c.level).FirstOrDefault( c => c.FullPrice > 100)

similar to first method we also have a method called last


courses.Last method is present in linq

we also have SingleOrDefault object
*********************************

Quantifying




_context.Courses.All( c => c.FullPrice)

to check all courses satisfy a particular criteria


this return a boolean

we also have a similar method called any

context.Courses.Any(c => c.Level ==1)





**************************************



aggregating

sometimes we just want to get the count of database

context.Courses.Count()

avg sum max and min
