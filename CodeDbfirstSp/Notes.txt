************* funtion import


we can change the name here and it will internally map to our stored procedure


now why will you requ to change the name of the function

in lot of dbs functions start with func

and stored procedure start with sp

if we do dbContext.funcGetAuthorCourses()

we can change the name to follow the standard convention

so we can remove this func 

and put it like getGetAuthor courses

now lets take a look at getCourses function import

now in this case it returns complex 

how it complex different from entities

but entity framework also supports a different type which is called a comlex type



so as the model is similar to data  
we can modify the return type to Course

and we can delete the complex type

a good example is when stored procedure joins two tables and returns data



in that case the result cannot be mapped to your existing enitites


now lets add complex type for our getCourse

now while editing how do we add a complex tag

by default the name of the complex type is name of the stored procedure and name of 

of the stored_procedure

note that we have full control over this class
