i querable is an interface that derives from IEnumerable



i enumerable represent any object that can be enumerated
we can use forach block
string array list dictionary

so any that is querable is enumerable

so what is the difference between iqueryable and ienumerable

i querable allows queries to be extended without being immediatley executed

so if we do context.Courses

this is a dbset class 
and dbSet class implements IQuerable interface

so we can store this in 

IQueryble <Course>  courses = context.courses;

var filtered  = course.Where(c => c.Level ==1 )

for each( var course in filtered)
	Console.Writeline(course.Name)

now what if we change the IQuerable to IEnumerable

here in profile we are gonna see all the courses and not filtered by 1

the reason for that is when you use IEnumerable you cannot extend a query

let see the difference

IQuerable<Course> x 
x.Where()

if i change from IEnumerable to IQuerable

then we will see overloads that support expression

expression are only passed and not executing at  this time

so this expression is not executed and stored in expression object
and simply called when expression is executed

but when i change this to IEnumerable 

the overloads required delegate

means that are called immeditely
