************** Introduction
we will learn how to add update remove objects

we will also use linqpad

in DbContext

we have change tracker

that tracks changes in objects

when you add object
it marks it as added

and the same is marked for modified

for remove the change tracker sets it to deleted

all of these changes are in memory

when we call save changes method

then they are transacted to db
once this is done

change tracker mark agains them as unsaved
