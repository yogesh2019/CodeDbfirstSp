linq extention methods 

so lets start with restriction

extension methods takes

courses.where()

this method takes a func of course and bool

this is a delegate

where ever there is func we can write a lambda expression

orderBy

again it takes a lambda expression Order(c => c.Name)

if you want to order by multiple properties 

then we use 

Thenby(c => c.Level)


you can use orderbyDescending

after .you can press enter 




*********** projection

.select => new {courseName = c.Name , AuthorName = c.Author.name}

since we have navigation property here we dont need joins here

Iquerable interface derives form IEnumerable

i querable it returning a list of list of tags

so the things is when you are using 

select on list 
you will end up getting llist of list


you can create flat list by doing selectMany

**********Set


you can avoid duplicates using distinct method

select
.distint()

************** groping

by grouping we mean to break down the list into multiple levels


courses.
groupby

this takes a func
with c and key on which we want to break down the courses

groupby(c => c.Level)


under loop

group.key


course.Name

as i told 
************************** we start with inner join
context.Courses.Join(
 it takes IEnumerable,


when ever you see a func just use lambda exp

, c=> c.authorId
a => a.id
)

so you are using authodId on the course and
id on author to join

now the question is what should happen after joining


that is our 4th argument


.cousres.join(context.authours,
c => c.authoid,
a => a.id,
(course, author)=> new{
courseName = course.Name,
AuthorName = author.Name

})
