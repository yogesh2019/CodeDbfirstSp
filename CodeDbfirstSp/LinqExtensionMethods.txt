linq extention methods 

so lets start with restriction

extension methods takes

courses.where()

this method takes a func of course and bool

this is a delegate

where ever there is func we can write a lambda expression

orderBy

again it takes a lambda expression Order(c => c.Name)

if you want to order by multiple properties 

then we use 

Thenby(c => c.Level)


you can use orderbyDescending

after .you can press enter 




*********** projection

.select => new {courseName = c.Name , AuthorName = c.Author.name}

since we have navigation property here we dont need joins here

Iquerable interface derives form IEnumerable

i querable it returning a list of list of tags

so the things is when you are using 

select on list 
you will end up getting llist of list


you can create flat list by doing selectMany
